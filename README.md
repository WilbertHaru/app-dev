# Favorite Movie
**Title** *Big Bird*
The reason that this is my favorite movie, *though it seems weird to some* is because this was the very last movie that me and my bros *Zach and Christian (RIP my bro)* watched.
I'll never forget those moments where we ==laughed== so hard, we almost died because of the lack of air.
*`The main storyline of this movie is that, he had the face of a famous adult film star in thailand. When the trio went to visit thailand everyone thought that he was **Big Bird**`*
*`Throughout the movie the trio, faced challenges and they almost had their friendship broken. But with their closeness they overcomed it all*`
After watching the movie, we had a long discussion about our plans after we have finished our *Mini thesis*. We had a list of what we would do. 
*Good thing is, we did most of them before one of us sadly passed away*
So that is why **Big Bird** is one of my favorite movie till this day.
